Our last argument is how we want to approximate the contour we use cv2 CHAIN APPROX SIMPLE to compress horizontal vertical and diagonal segments into their endpoints only This saves both computation and memory If we wanted all the points along the contour without compression we can pass cv2 CHAIN APPROX NONE however be very sparing when using this function Retrieving all points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful of resources
